This module implements an interface for the internationalization of timecount. It allows users to easily change the language of [time writers](../classes/_index_.timewriter.html) based on [translation files](https://github.com/pjbatista/timecount/tree/master/src/locales).

Employ one of the following snippets to use it in your project:

- EcmaScript 6 or equivalent:
    ```javascript
    import { Locale } from "timecount/localization";
    ```
- Older EcmaScripts:
    ```javascript
    var localization = require("timecount").localization;
    // -or
    var timecount = require("timecount/localization");
    ```

### Currently supported languages

- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English (US) â€” Native, hardcoded
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Portuguese (Brazil)
- ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ Portuguese (Portugal)
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish (Spain)
- ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ Spanish (Mexico)
