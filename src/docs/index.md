This is the main module of timecount and contains objects that can manipulate time values, convert them, and write them in many different formats.

The interface [[NanosecondBasedTime]] is the base unit of time of timecount. [All other units](../interfaces/_index_.timeunitdatabase.html) are calculated from nanoseconds.

See the other modules of timecount: [localization](_localization_.html) and [utils](_utils_.html) for more information.
